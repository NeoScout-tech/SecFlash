Architecture
============

Overview
--------

SecFlash is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability. The system consists of several key components that work together to provide comprehensive vulnerability analysis capabilities.

Core Components
-------------

VulnerabilityAnalyzer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main entry point for vulnerability analysis. This component:

* Coordinates the analysis process
* Manages the workflow between components
* Provides a high-level API for users

NVDClient
~~~~~~~~~

Handles all interactions with the National Vulnerability Database:

* Makes API requests to NVD
* Implements rate limiting
* Caches responses
* Handles error cases

ReportGenerator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Responsible for creating detailed reports:

* Supports multiple output formats
* Generates visualizations
* Provides customizable templates
* Handles report formatting

NVDDatabase
~~~~~~~~~~

Manages local storage of vulnerability data:

* Implements SQLAlchemy models
* Handles data persistence
* Provides query interface
* Manages database migrations

Data Flow
--------

1. User initiates analysis through VulnerabilityAnalyzer
2. NVDClient fetches data from NVD API
3. Data is stored in NVDDatabase
4. ReportGenerator creates reports from stored data
5. Results are returned to user

Security Considerations
--------------------

* API key management
* Rate limiting
* Data validation
* Error handling
* Secure storage

Extensibility
------------

The architecture allows for easy extension through:

* Plugin system
* Custom analyzers
* Additional data sources
* New report formats
